# Hurricane_V2

This repository hosts the Hurricane SPY automation codebase. The detailed
architecture, setup instructions, and usage guide are documented in
[`docs/hurricane_spy_automation.md`](docs/hurricane_spy_automation.md).

If merge conflicts arise around this README, prefer keeping the project title
above and append any additional notes below rather than rewriting the header.
